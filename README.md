## Repository Purpose

This repository showcases an automated workflow for generating professional release notes for software projects. The core script provided here streamlines the release management process by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze, organize, and summarize all changes made to the codebase.

### Benefits

- **Consistency:**  
  Ensures that release notes are always well-structured and professionally written, regardless of the number or type of changes.

- **Efficiency:**  
  Saves time for maintainers by automating the tedious process of compiling and formatting release notes.

- **Intelligence:**  
  Uses AI to understand the context and significance of each change, resulting in more meaningful and accurate release documentation.

## How It Works

The workflow is designed for simplicity and automation, enabling technical writers or release managers to generate professional release notes with minimal effort:

1. **Trigger the Script:**  
   The technical writer (or any authorized user) runs the provided automation script in the repository.

2. **Automated Data Collection:**  
   The script connects to GitHub and automatically gathers all information.

3. **AI-Powered Analysis and Grouping:**  
   The collected data is sent to an AI service, which analyzes each change and intelligently decides the most appropriate section for it (e.g., "Fixed", "What's New", "Improved", "Known Issues", etc.).

4. **Release Notes Generation:**  
   The AI rewrites and summarizes the content in a clear, concise, and professional style, returning a complete set of release notes.

5. **Multi-Format Output:**  
   AI-generated release notes are saved in both Markdown and PDF formats, with custom styling for enhanced readability.

**In short:**  
A technical writer simply triggers the script, and—boom—the draft release note is created in GitHub, ready for review and publication.
