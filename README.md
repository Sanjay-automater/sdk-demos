# SDK Demos #Edit test

This repository contains small, self-contained demo examples showing how to use the SDK from several languages (Python, Node.js, and Go). Each example demonstrates:

- Basic initialization (using an API key from an environment variable)
- A minimal request to a placeholder endpoint
- Simple error handling

Pick an example in the `examples/` directory and follow that example's README for run instructions.

Common notes
- Set your API key as an environment variable (API_KEY) before running any demo.
- Replace the placeholder endpoint and SDK usage with your real SDK calls or client initialization.

Contributing
- Add examples for other languages under `examples/`.
- Open a PR with improvements or additional guides.
